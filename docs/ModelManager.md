# ModelManager

The `ModelManager` is a browser based interface for viewing models and sorting them by
hyperparameters. It is very early in development, and currently its main use is generating the
tensorboard command to view models with a chosen set of hyperparameters.

You can start the `ModelManager` by opening the `ModelManager/index.html` file, and selecting your
models directory on main page.
