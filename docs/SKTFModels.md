# SKTFModels

This module provides examples of models built using the `SciKitWrapper` module. This is a good place
to start if you wish to implement your own models using this wrapper.

Currently this module provides only the `BasicRegressor` class, which inherits from `TFRegressor`
and implements a basic multilayer feedforward network for regressions.
